# 🐹 Image Recognition of Different Hamster Breeds Using Convolutional Neural Networks 📷 
This repository contains some of the source files for my undergraduate thesis entitled "Image Recognition of Different Hamster Breeds Using Convolutional Neural Networks"

## ✨ Features
- 🤖 Tailor-made CNN model for hamster breed identification based on VGG16 architecture
- 📷 Captures images using webcam (we used Logitech C270 as our main camera)
- 📁 File dialog for image uploads

## 🛠️ Built With
- **Raspberry Pi 4B** with 4GB RAM as its main hardware
- **python** — core programming language (both training and application development)
- **TensorFlow** — deep learning framework used for model training and deployment
- **Keras** – high-level API for building and customizing the VGG16-based CNN model
- **tkinter** — standard GUI library
- **customtkinter** — modern UI look

## 📝 Notes
This repo only includes the code for the application software specifically made for Raspberry Pi 4B, and the confusion matrix of the custom-made CNN model for hamster detection.
