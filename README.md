# Image Recognition of Different Hamster Breeds Using Convolutional Neural Networks
This repository contains some of the source files for my undergraduate thesis entitled "Image Recognition of Different Hamster Breeds Using Convolutional Neural Networks"

## üìù Note
This repo only includes the code for the application software specifically made for Raspberry Pi 4B, and the confusion matrix of the custom-made CNN model for hamster detection.
