# Undergraduate Thesis
This repository contains some of the source files for my undergraduate thesis entitled "Image Recognition of Different Hamster Breeds Using Convolutional Neural Networks"

## Note
This repo only includes the code for the application software specifically made for Raspberry Pi 4B, and the confusion matrix of the custom-made CNN model for hamster detection
